Things to do now:
- [x] nix
    - [x] create directories for each device
    - [x] move files there and symlink
- [x] home-manager
    - [x] do same as for nix
- [x] symlink the rest of the home files
- [x] symlink the rest of the config files
- [x] xmonad specific config for streaming pc
- [x] configure reddup and store its config here as well


Bikeshedding for next time:
- [ ] look into nixops
- [ ] refactor/merge nix files
- [ ] do the same for home-manager
- [ ] write scripts to do the symlinking?
- [ ] setup nvim via home-manager
