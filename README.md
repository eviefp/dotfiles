# My dotfiles

```sh
sudo --preserve-env nixos-rebuild switch
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

## Just show me your vim/emacs config

Vim: config/nvim/init.vim
Emacs: home-manager/emacs.nix


NOTE that the emacs config will need some tweaking, since it's designed
to run under `nix`.

## How do things work?

TODO: fill this in as soon as I end up the `shell.nix` update-nix idea.
